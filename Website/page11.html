<h1> Question 11 </h1>
<p> If you could change it, how would you change it (is it a problem to<br> change number of housing sizes etc. Implementing different policies)? </p>
<body> If were to change it, there are two options we can take and the method in how we approach them.
<br><br>
1.Even distribution: By evenly distributing the indigenous population, it creates a fairer society and <br> encourages greater standard of living for all Indigenous Australians. <br><br> 
To do so, we should:<br>
- Increase the housing opportunity for Indigenous Australian <br>
- Provide more/ greater help system for Indigenous Australians that are trapped within a low standard of living<br>
- Increase the job opportunities for indigenous Australians within the inner suburbs
<br><br>
2. Condense communities: Communities where individuals are of the same ethnicity is beneficial as <br> each individual feels a greater connection with someone similar, similar to the community of Cabramatta.<br><br>

However, it is not enough to simply put them all in the <br> same area, as we should encourage this community atmosphere by:<br>
- Creating public spaces that encourages community involvement<br>
- Inspire community involvements with social events <br>
