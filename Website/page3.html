<h1> Question 3 </h1>
<p> Which government department do you think will use and provide evidence <br>	some government departments that may benefit from the data? </p>
<body> The Federal and State government can use this data as an administrative record as well <br> as assist in being aware of the Indigenous health and welfare in Australia.<br> 
Government can integrate ways to address the gaps in health and <br> welfare through monitoring this information over time. <br><br> E.g. provides a record of where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander lived in Major Cities,<br> Inner Regional, Outer Regional or Remote Australia and any changes over time.
<br><br>
The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare are aiming to close the gap in disadvantage <br> by promoting careers in health information so they can utilise this data to know <br> the best areas to target their recruitment.

The Australian Institute of Criminology also utilises this data in <br>examining the disparity between crime rates in certain areas to the <br>relevance of the number of Indigenous people living in the area.<br>
