<h1> Question 7 </h1>
<p> How does it relate to the latte line? </p>
<body> 
This hypothetical line is a guiding principle in the planning <br> of the cityâ€™s future. More jobs are created to the north and more <br> housing is created to the south. Currently jobs are to the east and <br>housing developments are in the west.<br><br>

The data set does relate to the latte line at all. However, this <br>does not mean that there is equality to indigenous communities<br> within the Sydney region. Majority of indigenous Australians <br>occupy the outer regions of Sydney whereas Sydney CBD is mainly <br>occupied by non-indigenous Australians.
